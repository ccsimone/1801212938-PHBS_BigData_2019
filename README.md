The first homework is uploaded as Homework_1.MD.

The second homework is in .ipynb format as HW2.ipynb .

The homework2 is uploaded before the former due at 11:59pm 12/22/2019.

**A suggestionï¼š Considering that it takes the review time to complete the homework before the exam, I suggest that students who complete homework 2 before the original ddl can get a bonus on HW2. Of course, just a fair suggestion, never mind.**
