The first homework is uploaded as Homework_1.MD.

The second homework is a coding work, I have uploaded in .ipynb format as HW2.ipynb .

For the formula in homework may not checkable， please notice the following：

Problem 2 question 1：

  Linear model with L1 regularization： $$C(L1)=∑^n|yi−yi^ˆ|$$
    
  Linear model with L2 regularization： $$C(L2)=∑^n(yi−yi^ˆ)^2$$

Problem 4：

  $$θj=θj-α\\frac{\\partial J(θ0, θ1)}{\\partial θj}$$
