The first homework is uploaded as Homework_1.MD.

The second homework is a coding work, I have uploaded in .ipynb format as HW2.ipynb .

In HW2, Problem 1 question 2: Write down the mathematical formula for the linear model.
The answer is in the explanatory note. Writtern as：

    "Problem 2 question 1：\n",
    "\n",
    "linear model with L1 regularization： $$C(L1)=∑^n|yi−yi^ˆ|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "linear model with L2 regularization： $$C(L2)=∑^n(yi−yi^ˆ)^2$$"
